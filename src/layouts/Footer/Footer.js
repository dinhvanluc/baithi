        <p>My favorite pet is the baby chicken. I have a small group of chickens at home, including a mother hen and her adorable chicks. The entire body of these little chicks is covered with a soft, light yellow layer of down. Their beaks are as delicate as two small rice husks, and their tiny feet require tender care.</p>
